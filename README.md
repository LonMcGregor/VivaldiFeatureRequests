# Stuff

* Need "requests" library from pip
* Use python 3
* Run using `python scraper.py`
* Don't use the js scraper any more - it was hacky and subject to bugs
* Access the full page at https://lonmcgregor.github.io/VivaldiFeatureRequests/ instead of running locally, to avoid overwhelming the forum server

## TODO

* read nodebb api from command line results in duplicated topics. No idea how to solve this.
